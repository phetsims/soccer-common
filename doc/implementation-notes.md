This project is a common code repo that defines model and view components for "soccer" related simulations. These
are typically used to show random values generated by kick distances.

### Supported Features

* PhET-iO
* Alt-input
* i18n and dynamic layout

### Disposal Not Supported

Files in this repo are designed to exist for the lifetime of the sim, and to be preallocated. Dispose is not supported.

### KickDistributionStrategy

The SoccerSceneModel has a KickDistributionStrategy which determines where the kicks will fall. Each kick location is
determined
at the time of the kick (not predetermined). For the random skew strategy, it re-randomizes to left/right skew on reset.

### SoccerBall

A soccer ball is like a data point that has a null value until it lands, then it takes a numerical value.
See SoccerBallPhase for the full list of phases a soccer ball may take.
