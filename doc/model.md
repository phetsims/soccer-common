This document is a high-level description of the model used in PhET's _Soccer Common_ repository, which is used as a
foundation for simulations including _Center and Variability_ and _Mean Share and Balance_.

The _Soccer Common_ repository is used to create [_Soccer Scenes_](#soccer-scenes) in which one or more _kickers_ can kick _soccer balls_,
which land along a horizontal number line and stack vertically. The main functionalities of the model include:

## Soccer Scenes
Each _Soccer Scene_ contains an independent set of _kickers_ and _soccer balls_, which can be kicked using a specific 
_kick distance strategy_. A simulation screen may contain one or more _Soccer Scenes_.

## Number Line
Each _Soccer Scene_ contains a horizontal number line, labeled with integer values.

## Kickers
The people kicking the soccer balls are referred to as _Kickers_. Each one has a set of images that show the person
at various phases of kicking a soccer ball. _KickerPhases_ can be _INACTIVE_, _READY_, _POISED_ or _KICKING_.

## Soccer Balls
The soccer balls that can be kicked within a given _Soccer Scene_. Each soccer ball has a null value until it 
lands, at which time it takes an integer numerical value. Each soccer ball has a _SoccerBallPhase_ that describes the 
portion of the kick it is currently in. _SoccerBallPhases_ can be _INACTIVE_, _READY_, _FLYING_, _STACKING_ or _STACKED_.

## Kick Distribution Strategy
Used to determine the distances for each kicked soccer ball. The kick distances can be randomly chosen to be a left skewed distribution, 
a right skewed distribution, or a symmetric distributions. The simulation is also capable of creating a distribution based on exact 
distances per kick. 

More information can be found in detail in _KickDistributionStrategy_.
